# Harry Potter: Mortal Kombat

This Greenfoot project was created by Riddhi Lamba and Lindsay Elfant in March 2023.

It is inspired by the concept of "dueling" in the book series "Harry Potter".

Please check out the "Instructions" file for details on how to play and the in-game features.

The "HarryPotter-MortalKombat.gfar" file can be downloaded to play the game directly on Greenfoot, while the assets and code files can all be found in the "HarryPotter-MortalKombat" directory. A full demo of the game can be found in the "Harry Potter Dueling Game.mp4" file.
